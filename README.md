# Image-processor
Java OOP

It is simple image processor. It allows the user to choose and
load an image file from the disk and then apply any of three operations. The three
operations are:


 Gray scale – this turns the image into a monochrome image.

 Tint – this allows the user to choose whether to tint the image towards red, green or
blue and how strong the tinting effect should be.

 Chromakey – this allows the user to select a second image, a key colour to blend
through and a sensitivity to match the key colour; the second image will then show
through all the regions of the first image that match the key colour.
